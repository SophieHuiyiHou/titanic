# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This notebook is a beginner-friendly project for solving the Titanic survival prediction problem, originally hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview). It walks through the process of data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using attributes like age, gender, and passenger class.
- **Data**: Provided by Kaggle (train.csv, test.csv)
- **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification using machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression).

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Launching the Notebook

After installing dependencies, launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "getting-started-with-titanic.ipynb"
```
